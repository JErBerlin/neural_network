TODO:
 * Fix recursive backpropagation through all layers
 * Make it possible to create/remove synapses/neurons
 * Make it possible to cover from a damage (say a neuron is removed)
 * Support for 0 (zero) hidden layers, input directly connected to output layer
 * Fix nn_connected() according to comment
 * Make network dynamic: when learning it should add/remove synapses if necessary
 * Fix nn_generate_synapses() to not add 100% synapses (related to dynamic synapses)
 * Override transfer function (like threshold) of the neurons with a custom function pointer
 * rename output/input of neuron (cunfusion with the same values of synapse)
