TODO:
 * Fix nn_connected() according to comment
 * implement nn_fully_connected()
 * rename output/input of neuron (confusion with the same values of synapse)
 * make sure nn_size() returns correct value if different number of layers is picked

IDEAS:
 * Make it possible to create/remove synapses/neurons in a network
 * Support for 0 (zero) hidden layers, input directly connected to output layer
 * Support for synapses within same layer? Support for synapses to previous layer?
 * Make network dynamic: when learning it should add/remove synapses if necessary
 * Fix nn_generate_synapses() to not add 100% synapses (related to dynamic synapses), rename to sometihng else?
